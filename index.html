                    to a wealthy family, with maternal connections to the barony. His soldier father also had noble lineage.

                <h1>His Theory</h1>

                He believed that the power should not be held by one person, it should be seperated into 3 branches,
                which are <strong>Legislative</strong>, <strong>Executive</strong>, and <strong>Judicial</strong>.

                Montesquieu has a big impact on the world, he did a lot of stuff, especially in french, where he lived,
                but what made him so popular is his sense of humor, he was a fun judge, and had a big power in his country,
                he thought that the power should not be held by one person,it shoud be held by 3 branches of government.
            </h3>
            <h3 class="justify margin-top">
                During his travels Montesquieu did not avoid the social pleasures that he had sought in Paris, but his serious ambitions were strengthened. He thought for a time of a diplomatic career but on his return to France decided to devote himself to literature. He hastened to La Brède and remained there, working for two years. Apart from a tiny but controversial treatise on La Monarchie universelle, printed in 1734 but at once withdrawn (so that only his own copy is extant), he was occupied with an essay on the English constitution
